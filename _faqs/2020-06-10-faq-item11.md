title: Is HIBK tracking me?
---

No. HIBK is a static website hosted on Github Pages so there is no server side processing. API requests, responses, and privacy analysis all take place locally in your browser. No tracking scripts. Everything is [open source](https://github.com/haveibeenknown/haveibeenknown) on GitHub.
